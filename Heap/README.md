# Heap Data Structure

A Heap is a special Tree-based data structure in which the tree is a complete binary tree.
Generally, Heaps can be of two types:

* **Max-Heap**: In a Max-Heap the key present at the root node must be greatest among the keys present at all of it’s children. The same property must be recursively true for all sub-trees in that Binary Tree.

* **Min-Heap**: In a Min-Heap the key present at the root node must be minimum among the keys present at all of it’s children. The same property must be recursively true for all sub-trees in that Binary Tree.
